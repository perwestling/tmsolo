# tmsolo
Intention is to create a companion app for when playing the boardgame
 Terraforming Mars sol

Some plans:
- Should be an android app
- I would like to try out kotlin
- Maybe it can be built using bazle?
- Should mainly be used to pull cards
- It should be possible to set up a seed so that game draws can be
  repeated, typically to play the same at different boards
- Possibly be used in TM tournaments at game conventions

This is far from ready...
